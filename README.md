# Generic Interprocess Communication

**General Interprocess Communication** (or _gipc_, pronounced like gypsy /ʤɪ́psɪ/) is a library that abstracts away common things in interprocess communication to speed up development and reduce errors.

## Usage

To get a sense of how to use gipc, please read the [examples](./examples); these show roughly how the code would look in an application, alongside explanations of why everything happens in the order that it does.

If you don't want to do that, that's fine! The crate's documentation should be sufficient to give you a starting point, although it's probably not as good as the examples.
